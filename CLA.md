### Build

An object of the Agreement, the result of the original authorship work by a team of authors ("Company"): a complex intellectual property object — a video game — including, but not limited to, source code, object code, tools, game assets, specifications, UI/UX design, narrative elements, and other creative components, based on the revision and translation into Russian of the open version of *Space Station 14* and the Company's artistic vision.

The aggregation of individual elements constitutes the Build. Elements created beyond the original material are objects of copyright and/or related rights.

### Contribution

> For this purpose, "submission" means any form of communication — electronic, oral, or written — sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including messages on mailing lists, source control systems, or issue tracking systems operated by or on behalf of the Company.

Communications explicitly marked **"Not a contribution"** are excluded.

By providing a Contribution, the Contributor grants the Company a simple, free, irrevocable, non-exclusive license for the full term of their rights according to their jurisdiction’s law and/or international law.
