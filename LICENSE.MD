### 1. General Provisions  
This License Agreement (hereinafter, the "Agreement") governs the use of the "RPS-eXtended" project (hereinafter, the "Project"), including its source code, resources, assets, and any related documentation, developed by the "RPS-eXtended" and "Dark Station" teams, as well as any integrated third-party components. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the terms of third-party licenses applicable to certain components, the terms of those third-party licenses shall take precedence.

By using the Project, you (hereinafter, the "User") agree to the terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are not authorized to use, copy, or distribute the Project or its components.

### 2. Open-Source Code (CLA)  
2.1. All parts of the Project’s source code explicitly designated as open and hosted in the Project’s public repositories are distributed under the [Role Play Systems Conributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://github.com/rp-s-tech/SS14_Workstation/blob/develop/CLA.md).

2.2. Any User who accesses such open-source code must comply with the CLA terms, including, but not limited to, using source code only within the boundaries of this repository for contribution purposes. Any use of the code outside this repository, whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes, is strictly prohibited.

2.3. If any provisions of this Agreement conflict with the CLA regarding open-source portions of the code, the CLA terms shall take precedence.

### 3. Closed Resources and Proprietary Code  
3.1. Any portions of the source code, resources, assets, libraries, submodules, or code fragments not explicitly marked as open are considered proprietary ("Closed Resources") and may not be used outside of the Project.

3.2. It is strictly prohibited to copy, modify, distribute, publicly display, decompile, or otherwise use Closed Resources without prior written permission from the current owner of the RPS-eXtended Project or the founder of Dark Station.

3.3. In the event of unauthorized disclosure (leak) of Closed Resources, any attempt to use, adapt, integrate, or distribute these materials in other projects is strictly forbidden. Such use will be considered a copyright infringement and may result in civil, administrative, or criminal liability under applicable law.

### 4. Exceptions for RPSX Servers  
4.1. Servers owned or operated by the RPS-eXtended team or Dark Station ("RPSX Servers") are granted the right, without any time limitation, to use both open and closed portions of the code and resources exclusively for their server operations.

4.2. Granting such rights to RPSX Servers does not imply any automatic extension or transfer of these rights to third parties.

### 5. Use of Third-Party Resources and Code  
5.1. If the Project incorporates third-party code or resources distributed under open or free licenses (including, but not limited to, MIT, GPL, CC licenses), those components retain their original licenses and the respective rights of their authors.

5.2. Changes made by the Project to such third-party components, where possible, are released under AGPLv3 (for open-source parts of the code) or remain under their original licenses if required by those licenses or their authors.

5.3. The Project is obliged to credit the original authors and include the applicable licensing terms for all third-party components in its documentation, code comments, resource metadata, or accompanying files.

### 6. Licensing of Assets  
6.1. Most graphic, audio, texture, and other media files ("Assets") used in the Project are licensed under [CC-BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) or another license explicitly indicated in the respective file’s metadata. Certain Assets may be licensed under [CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) or similar non-commercial licenses.

6.2. When using such Assets in commercial projects that are not compatible with their licensing terms, you must remove or replace these Assets, and if required, provide references to their original licenses, authors, and sources.

### 7. Addressing Possible Violations and Correcting Attribution  
7.1. The Project seeks to comply with all applicable licenses, copyrights, and conditions imposed by external rights holders.

7.2. If a violation is discovered or brought to the attention of the Project’s team—such as incorrect attribution, missing license references, or use contrary to the license terms—the Project will make reasonable and good-faith efforts to contact the rights holder.

7.3. With the rights holder’s consent, the Project will promptly update its documentation, source code, metadata, or other accompanying materials to correct attributions, and may replace or remove problematic code fragments or Assets to ensure compliance with licensing obligations.

### 8. Special Conditions and Additional Rights  
8.1. Any additional permissions, exceptions, or special conditions that extend beyond the scope of this Agreement or beyond the AGPLv3 terms for the open-source components, as well as beyond the restrictions for Closed Resources, must be provided in writing by the current owner of the RPS-eXtended Project or the founder of Dark Station.

8.2. In the absence of such written permission, no additional rights or concessions are granted.

### 9. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability
